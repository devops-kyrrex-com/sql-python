First, the code imports the psycopg2 and errors modules from the psycopg2 library. Then, it defines three functions:

1. connect_to_database: a function that establishes a connection to the database and returns the connection and cursor.
2. close_database_connection: a function that closes the connection to the database.
3. grant_read_access_to_public_schema: the main function of the script, which grants read permission to tables in the database for the specified user.

Next, connection parameters to the PostgreSQL database are defined in the db_params variable, and the username for which permission to read tables is to be granted is defined in the user variable. The script then establishes a connection to the database and gets a list of databases. For each database in the list, it calls the grant_read_access_to_public_schema function, which grants read permission to tables in the database for the specified user. In the grant_read_access_to_public_schema function, a query is first formed to grant permission to read tables in the public schema for the specified user. Then, it forms a query to create an event trigger and a function that will be executed during the trigger. After both queries are successfully executed, the script records the changes in the database and closes the connection. If the trigger already exists, the script ignores the error and moves on to the next database.

event_query: This code creates the grant_read_access() function, which returns an event_trigger and contains a FOR loop that iterates through the table objects in the database where the trigger was installed. Table objects are obtained using the query SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands() WHERE command_tag IN ('CREATE TABLE'). Each table object is processed by the format function, which uses the obj.object_identity value to create a query for GRANT SELECT on the corresponding table. The query is executed using EXECUTE. Therefore, this function is designed to create a trigger that automatically adds read permission (GRANT SELECT) to every table created in the database where the trigger was installed.

event_trigger_query: This code creates the grant_read_access_trigger event trigger, which is executed at the end of the specified command type (ddl_command_end) and when the command tag matches one from the list ('CREATE TABLE'). When the trigger fires, it executes the grant_read_access() function, which was previously described, which automatically adds read permission (GRANT SELECT) to every table created in the database where the trigger was installed. Therefore, this trigger is designed to automatically grant read permission to every table created in the database where it is installed.
